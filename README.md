We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 
- [Terraform 1.5.4](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-security-group/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Basic
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
# use this
  module "security_group" {
    source      = "clouddrove/security-group/aws"
    version     = "2.0.0"
    name        = "app"
    environment = "test"
    vpc_id      = module.vpc.vpc_id

    ## INGRESS Rules
    new_sg_ingress_rules_with_cidr_blocks = [{
      rule_count  = 1
      from_port   = 22
      protocol    = "tcp"
      to_port     = 22
      cidr_blocks = [module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block, "172.16.0.0/16"]
      description = "Allow ssh traffic."
      },

        to_port     = 27017
        cidr_blocks = ["172.16.0.0/16"]
        description = "Allow Mongodb traffic."
      }
    ]

      ## EGRESS Rules

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
